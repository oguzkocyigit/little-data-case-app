### A brief note on what you found hardest about the challenge
```
Since there are no font and color values in the design, I can say that it was a bit difficult for me to decide on them.
```

### A brief note on how you could improve your code further
```
I did not want to use a third party library while doing the case study. If this was my own project, I would use bulma.io for the css library (light weight) and use the element.io library for form elements to import only the components I need so that it doesn't affect the project's performance.
