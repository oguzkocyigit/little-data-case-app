# Littledata front-end test project
## Overall Instructions
Overall, this challenge is about writing good, clean code, and following the desired implementation closely.
Using the web for help is perfectly fine, but be sensible: if a critical chunk of your solution is copied from a github repo, that’s clearly not ok. Remember that your solution should demonstrate your ability as far as possible. Any significant use of external code must be referenced.
## Objective
You have to create a multi-page HTML welcome flow that would be shown to Littledata users as they enter the application.

The welcome flow has to adapt to the user’s state, and only show relevant screens to that user. For example, for a new user we’d like to show a survey and ask some questions about their setup. However, for a returning user, we’d like to take them directly to the app.

In the repo are all the assets, wireframes, and a link to the prototype to clearly understand the desired end result.

We want to see how you solve the problem, how you write the code and how you create the UI.
## Desired Implementation
This is a frontend test, and no backend implementation is expected. For the forms, you can log the user inputs to the console upon submission.
For ‘supporting screens’, a low-fidelity implementation is acceptable as long as it fits well in the flow. Screenshots below.
For core screens, a pixel perfect implementation is expected (as far as possible). Screenshots below.

## Screens

## Note
**WELCOME SCREEN** 3 should only be shown to the user when their **Store URL** contains `myshopify.com`. In all other cases, take the user directly to the end screen.
For clarity, in the prototype ([link](https://www.figma.com/proto/k3ecWPPwEE6IqzI2H6DHK4/Frontend-Developer-Test?node-id=1%3A231&viewport=266%2C395%2C0.06883514672517776&scaling=scale-down-width) below), we have added these as 2 separate cases (**CASE** 1 & **CASE 2**) next to the Store URL form input on **WELCOME SCREEN 1**.

## What we’re looking for
At a high level, a great solution is one which:
- Delivers all of the desired functionality
- Could be picked up by a colleague and understood quickly
- Could be extended or reworked in the future
- Uses the features of your chosen programming language well
- Handles unexpected inputs appropriately
- To be specific, your code will be evaluated for:
- Functionality (whether it solves the problem)
- Code quality (e.g. appropriate use of functions)
- Cleanliness (e.g. variable naming)
- Test coverage

## What to submit and how
Host the project with a service of your choice and send us a URL link for us to view
Please fork this repo and send us a link to your fork. Or send us a Zip file.
The notes.txt file should include:
- Brief instructions on how to run your code
- Any notes we should bear in mind (e.g. why you made an unusual choice)
- A brief note on what you found hardest about the challenge
- A brief note on how you could improve your code further
- Any feedback to us on how to improve either the challenge itself or the recruitment process so far


Good Luck!


## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### A brief note on what you found hardest about the challenge
```
Since there are no font and color values in the design, I can say that it was a bit difficult for me to decide on them.
```

### A brief note on how you could improve your code further
```
I did not want to use a third party library while doing the case study. If this was my own project, I would use bulma.io for the css library (light weight) and use the element.io library for form elements to import only the components I need so that it doesn't affect the project's performance.
```
